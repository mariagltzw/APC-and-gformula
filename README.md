Code for the paper "The Contribution of Health Behaviors to Depression Risk Across Birth Cohorts"

In this paper, we combine age-period-cohort analysis with the g-formula in order to quantify the contribution of health behavior to cohort differences in depression risk in older US adults. We perform subgroup analyses by gender and race/ethnicitiy. The code provided is for replicating the main analysis. If you are interested in replicating the senstivitiy analysis feel free to reach out!

The data source for this analysis is the Health and Retirement Study which is accessible at (http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/).
